        <p>A simple, completely vegetarian salad for those guests of yours who do not comsume flesh. This salad is lovely,

        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A base green (we recommend a wild blend or a combination of Arugula and Dandelion)</li>
                <li>A clove of garlic</li>
                <li>Fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>Several thin slices of lotus root</li>
                <li> Green onion</li>
                <li>Several thin slices of a finely pickled Beet</li>
                <li>Thinly sliced steamed sweet potato</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Edible pink flower petals for garnish</li>
                <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <p> Cut the clove of garlic and generously rub the serving plate with the cut side. Crush the garlic and spread finely over the plate. 
            Arrange the green leaves delicately on one side of the palate and arrange the onion, beet, potato and lotus on the other side, taking 
            careful consideration of the color layout of the plating. Refer to the photo above as needed. Once completed,
            squeeze the fresh lemon juice sparingly over the plating, and follow with a light drizzle of olive oil. Garnish with the petals, and lighlt
            sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
